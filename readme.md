I used PythonAnywhere to host Python-based web applications directly from the platform. It supports web frameworks such as Django, Flask, and web2py, among others.

1. git clone https://github.com/mariabb/romanianmovies.git  (clone the Repository from git hub, this is the name in my case)
2. create a virtual environment , ‚Äúvenv‚Äù is the name :
`mkvirtualenv venv`
3. `cd romanianmovies `
4. To install the packages listed in a requirements.txt file, run the command: 
`pip install -r requirements`
5.open the settings file in Web section and modify the path, then:
* `DEBUG = True`
* `ALLOWED_HOSTS = [‚Äòhttps://mariab.pythonanywhere.com/‚Äô] `
6. To  upload images, additional settings are required; see the instruction s here: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/
